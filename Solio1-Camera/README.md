## [Perception Models for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/nineRishav/Solio-S186/blob/master/Solio1-Camera/P1_perception.py)


### Overview

This project integrates multiple perception models to enhance the situational awareness and decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles. The system uses a ZED camera for capturing images and depth information, and YOLO models for detecting traffic lights, traffic signs, collision warnings, speed bumps, potholes, and pedestrian intentions.

## FAQ

### Q: All hardware connections are fine, but why isn't the vehicle actuating when running the navigation code?
**A:** Ensure the ORIN is blinking fast, the MABX does not show any errors, there are no ESP errors on the vehicle, and the Private CAN is ON. Additionally, start the perception system before running the navigation file to avoid any errors.

### Q: Why is the vehicle not following the designated path and moving erratically?
**A:** The vehicle's GNSS system likely needs calibration. Check the [pos_type](https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/Logs/BESTPOS.htm#Position_VelocityType) status in `bestpos` topic of GNSS system.

### Q: Vehicle suddenly in the middle of path, not able to actuate properly on scenerio or going on the right path ? 
**A:** Check the `Roslaunch` on the terminal, possibly the wire was loose and rosclaunch terminal screen was terminated.
